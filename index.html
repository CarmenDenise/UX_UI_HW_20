      <p class="lead">It is difficult for people to communicate and plan itineraries together around individual schedules and preferences.</p>
        <p>The Flock app is being designed to provide opportunities to communicate, organize, and share plans with others when planning travel. We have observed that Masha is unsuccessfully planning trips for multiple people in a way that makes everyone happy but she’s having to use multiple apps which is time consuming and confusing. How might we improve our app so that Masha is successful based upon her ease in both planning and communicating? </p>

<!--Jumbotron . Final Thoughts-->

  <div class="container">
    <h1 class="display-4"> Final Thoughts</h1>
    <p class="lead">This project not only allowed me to learn new skills in the UX process but the chance to reflect on my own personal strengths and weaknesses. I learned to check my ego, use my natural thoughtfulness through research, and stop my obsessive habit to stress over details.</p>
    <p>My ideas for an app were initially too broad and focused on multiple features. Mistakes were made and focus lost when I strayed away from my findings in the user research - I wanted to design an entire app overnight! In the future, I will start to focus on features that have minimal effort, high value, and solve my defined problems.  </p>
    <p>Additionally, user testing is so much more beneficial than I anticipated! I went into the testing fully confident that people will just confirm how great everything is, there would be no need for iteration, I mean I did spend hours on it, it was perfect right? No! My meticulous attention to detail doesn’t mean that I have it all figured out. Others pointed out the factors that I couldn’t see and I believe it drastically improved my design. I am a now a believer in testing before getting to attached to designs coupled with iteration, iteration, iteration!</p>
